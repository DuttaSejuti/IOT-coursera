4.Describe any privacy issues with the IoT device that never existed in the original version of the device. Compare the price of the original device to the price of the new IoT version of the device. When performing a price comparison, attempt to normalize for the changing value of currency over time by using an online inflation calculator
Ans-

**Privacy Issues**
It the door is connected to the home security system..It can be hacked and intruders can get into the home with criminal motives.

**Price** 
Normal door price 25$-150$ and more in 2020  ||       20$-125$ in 2010
Automated door price 200$-1200$ and more in 2020 ||   167$-1006$ in 2010
