1.Research two microcontrollers and provide information about them from their datasheets. 
There are several microcontroller manufacturers that you can investigate including Atmel,
Microchip, Freescale, TI, etc. For each microcontroller, report the following information.
(Be sure to include a link to an online reference where you found this information.)  

*Clock frequency
*Bitwidth of the datapath
*Size of Flash memory
*Number of pins
*Does the microcontroller contain an Analog-to-Digital Converter? If so, how many bits of precision does it have?



Ans- 1) Intel 8051 microcontroller
             *Clock frequency : 12MHz
             *Bitwidth of the datapath : 8bit
             *Size of Flash memory : 8Kb
             *Number of pins : 40 pins
             *Does the microcontroller contain an Analog-to-Digital Converter : Yes,it has. And it has 24 bits of precision.

2) ATmega328 microcontroller
             *Clock frequency : 20MHz
             *Bitwidth of the datapath : 8bit
             *Size of Flash memory : 32Kb
             *Number of pins : 44 pins
             *Does the microcontroller contain an Analog-to-Digital Converter : Yes,it has. And it has 10 bits of precision.

2.Research the Arduino and Raspberry Pi platforms. 

Indicate if there are operating systems which can be used on each platform. 
If there are, list those operating systems
State whether the operating systems are open source or not. 


Ans- Arduino : Arduino doesn't have any operating system 
     Rasberry Pi : Rasberry Pi can use different operating systems. Like: Raspbian , openelec , osmc.

osmc is an open source operating system.
raspbian is also an open source operating system
openelec is also an open source operating system.
